# Welcome to Systems for Design and Implementation

The work throughout the semester consisted in developing a full-stack web application using whichever technologies we wanted. 

I have chosen to create a car marketplace application.

( README in construction :) )

The repository for the frontend can be accessed [here](https://github.com/tiutcristian/mobile_frontend) and the one for the backend [here](https://github.com/tiutcristian/MobileClone).
