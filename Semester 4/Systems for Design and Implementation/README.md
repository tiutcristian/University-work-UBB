# Welcome to Systems for Design and Implementation

The work throughout the semester consisted in developing a full-stack web application using whichever technologies we found most suitable for the task.

I have chosen to create a car marketplace application, using Next.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. 

The application allows users to:
- register, log in, use 2-factor-authentication
- manage their car listings
- view all available cars on the platform
- browse through cars efficiently thanks to the infinite scroll feature
- filter cars by various criteria

The repository for the frontend can be accessed [here](https://github.com/tiutcristian/mobile_frontend) and the one for the backend [here](https://github.com/tiutcristian/MobileClone).
