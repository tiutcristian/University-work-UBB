# Technology Stack Comparison

## 1. Introduction
In this document I will compare frameworks for a web-based application, covering the frontend, backend, and database. The selected stack consists of:
- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

I will compare 
- Next.js vs. React for frontend
- Spring Boot vs. Express.js for backend
- PostgreSQL vs. MySQL for the database.

## 2. Frontend: Next.js vs. React
| Feature              | Next.js | React |
|----------------------|--------|-------|
| **Rendering**       | Supports SSR, SSG, ISR, and CSR | Only supports CSR (unless using additional libraries) |
| **Routing**        | File-based routing | Uses React Router for manual routing |
| **Performance**    | Optimized for fast loading (SSR, SSG) | Slower initial load due to CSR |
| **SEO**           | Excellent (SSR, SSG) | Poor (CSR-based SEO issues) |
| **API Routes**    | Built-in API handling | Requires a separate backend |
| **Ease of Use**   | Simple structure with automatic optimizations | Requires more configuration |
| **Community & Ecosystem** | Strong, backed by Vercel | Large ecosystem but needs extra tools for SSR |

**Conclusion:** Next.js is chosen due to its superior performance, built-in routing, and better SEO capabilities.

## 3. Backend: Spring Boot vs. Express.js
| Feature              | Spring Boot | Express.js |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Performance**    | Optimized, supports multithreading | Single-threaded, may struggle with high loads |
| **Scalability**    | Enterprise-level, highly scalable | Good for small to medium apps |
| **Security**       | Built-in security (Spring Security) | Requires manual implementation |
| **Ease of Use**    | More complex but powerful | Simpler, lightweight |
| **Community & Ecosystem** | Large enterprise adoption | Strong, but mostly for small applications |
| **Microservices Support** | Excellent | Requires third-party libraries |

**Conclusion:** Spring Boot is selected due to its superior scalability, built-in security, and strong enterprise support.

## 4. Database: PostgreSQL vs. MySQL
| Feature              | PostgreSQL | MySQL |
|----------------------|------------|-------|
| **Performance**    | Excellent for complex queries | Faster for simple reads/writes |
| **Scalability**    | Highly scalable | Good but not as efficient for large-scale applications |
| **ACID Compliance** | Fully ACID-compliant | ACID-compliant but with limitations |
| **JSON Support**   | Advanced JSONB storage | Basic JSON support |
| **Concurrency**    | Better handling of concurrent transactions | Lock-based concurrency, may cause delays |

**Conclusion:** PostgreSQL is chosen for its better scalability, ACID compliance, and advanced query capabilities.
