# Welcome to Software Engineering

The Software Engineering course consisted of working in teams to develop a software project.

The tech stack was chosen by the professor to be WinUI3, .NET, and SQLServer.

Firstly, we were split into teams by the faculty group number, resulting in teams of 28 people and have started developing the concept of the project, 

Then, we were split into smaller teams of 7 people, each team having its own team lead and being responsible for a specific part of the project.

After developing our part of the project, the projects were randomly assigned to other teams to take them over and continue the development until the end of the semester, which was a great way to learn how to work with other people's code and how to adapt to different coding styles. We also merged with another team of 7 people to continue the project, which was a great experience in terms of collaboration and communication.

We were then required to separate the project into API and frontend, with the API being developed in .NET and the frontend both in WinUI3 and ASP.NET.

Lastly, we merged once again with another team to continue the project and finish it.

Overall, the course was a great way to experience working in a team, developing a software project from scratch, and learning how to adapt to different coding styles and technologies.
