# copy the code from a2 to a3 and continue from there

# 2 main things
## Theoretical
- compute the complexities of sorting alg implemented in a2
		(at least be able to explain what is the complexity in best and worst case)
			
## Practical
- you have to be able to demonstrate the complexity
- time the algorithms
- add menu options 
    - Best case	
    - Average case
    - Worst case
- (for all of these create 5 list of numbers sorted depending on the option - 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000)
- (or ask user to provide length of first list = n and do n, 2n, 4n, 8n, 16n)
