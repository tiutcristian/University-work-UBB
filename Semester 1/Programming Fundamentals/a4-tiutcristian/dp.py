Problem 4
---------
Given an n * n square matrix with integer values, find the maximum length of a snake sequence.

A snake sequence begins on the matrix's top row (coordinate (0, i), 0 <= i < n). Each element of the sequence,
except the first one, must have a value Â±1 from the previous one and be located directly below,
or directly to the right of the previous element.

For example, element (i, j) can be succeeded by one of the (i, j + 1) or (i + 1, j) elements.
Display the length as well as the sequence of coordinates for one sequence of maximum length.
